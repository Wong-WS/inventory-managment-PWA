# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the Application

This is a vanilla JavaScript PWA that runs without build tools:

1. **Development Server**: Open `index.html` in a browser or use a local server like `python -m http.server 8000`
2. **Testing**: Manual testing in browser - no automated test framework
3. **PWA Installation**: Can be installed from browser when served over HTTPS

## Architecture Overview

### Core Structure
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no framework dependencies
- **Storage**: All data persisted in Firebase Firestore via `DB` module
- **Navigation**: Single-page app with tab-based navigation using templates
- **PWA Features**: Service worker for offline capability, manifest for app installation

### Module System
The application uses a modular architecture with these main components:

- **`js/database.js`**: Central data layer handling all CRUD operations for products, drivers, assignments, orders, and users
- **`js/app.js`**: Main application controller with tab navigation and role-based dashboard functionality
- **`js/auth.js`**: Authentication system with multi-role support (Admin, Sales Rep, Driver)
- **`js/products.js`**: Product management UI and operations
- **`js/drivers.js`**: Driver management UI and operations  
- **`js/assignments.js`**: Product assignment to drivers functionality
- **`js/orders.js`**: Order management with workflow system (pending/completed/cancelled)
- **`js/users.js`**: User management system with role-based access control
- **`js/my-orders.js`**: Driver interface for viewing assigned orders
- **`js/my-inventory.js`**: Driver interface for inventory monitoring with low stock alerts
- **`js/reports.js`**: Order and inventory reporting

### Data Flow
1. All modules interact through the global `DB` object
2. Each module follows the pattern: `init()` → `bindEvents()` → `load/update` methods
3. Data is immediately persisted to Firebase Firestore with real-time sync
4. Cross-module communication happens via direct method calls (e.g., `DashboardModule.updateDashboard()`)

### Key Data Structures
- **Products**: `{id, name, totalQuantity, createdAt}`
- **Drivers**: `{id, name, phone, createdAt, linkedUserId?}`
- **Users**: `{id, username, password, name, role, isActive, createdAt, driverId?}`
- **Assignments**: `{id, driverId, productId, quantity, assignedAt}`
- **Orders**: `{id, driverId, salesRepId, customerAddress, customerDescription, deliveryMethod, totalAmount, status, createdAt, completedAt?, lineItems[]}`
- **LineItems**: `{productId, productName, category, actualQuantity, isFreeGift}`

### Business Logic
- **User Roles**: Admin (full access), Sales Rep (orders + dashboard), Driver (view orders + inventory)
- **Authentication**: Secure PBKDF2 password hashing with session management
- **Inventory Management**: Products start with 0 quantity, increased via assignments to drivers
- **Assignment Flow**: Assigning products to drivers deducts from main inventory (`totalQuantity`)
- **Order Workflow**: Sales reps create orders → drivers view them → sales reps complete/cancel
- **Inventory Deduction**: Order creation reduces driver inventory, cancellation restores it
- **Driver Linking**: User accounts linked to driver profiles for proper data access

## Development Notes

- **No Build Process**: Direct file editing, refresh browser to see changes
- **State Management**: All state in Firebase with real-time listeners, no complex state management needed
- **Error Handling**: Basic validation with `alert()` for user feedback
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- **Dependencies**: Only Font Awesome CDN for icons

## Common Operations

### Adding New Features
1. Add UI template to `index.html` if needed
2. Create or modify relevant module in `js/`
3. Update `database.js` if new data structures needed
4. Test manually in browser

### Debugging
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Inspect Firebase Firestore in Firebase Console to see data
- Use browser's PWA debugging tools for service worker issues
- Check Network tab for Firebase API calls

### Data Management
- All data stored in Firebase Firestore (real-time sync)
- View/edit data in Firebase Console
- All data operations go through `DB` object methods
- Real-time listeners automatically sync changes across all users

## Firebase Setup

### Required Configuration
1. **Firebase Project**: Create a Firebase project at https://firebase.google.com/
2. **Firestore Database**: Enable Firestore in the Firebase console
3. **Authentication**: Enable Authentication (currently using custom auth, not Firebase Auth)
4. **Configuration**: Update `js/firebase-config.js` with your project credentials

### Firebase Collections
- `products` - Product catalog
- `drivers` - Driver profiles
- `users` - User accounts with authentication
- `assignments` - Product assignments to drivers
- `orders` - Order management
- `sales` - Sales records
- `stock_transfers` - Stock transfer history

### Security Notes
- Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Sessions are managed client-side with secure tokens
- Firebase Security Rules should be configured to restrict data access
- Default admin account: username `admin`, password `Admin123!`
