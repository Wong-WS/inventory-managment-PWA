Yo Lim, thanks for taking a look at this project

I need some guidence on what backend to use and what to use for deployment. Hopefully everything works as intended so I don't have to keep fixing/maintaining the code because of their line of business. I don't want to leave any footprint that may lead back to me. So I want this project to work as intended so I can leave everything.

I will use VPN like you said, and I plan to just tell my client to register the database/backend service themselve and I will log in and implement the backend (included the deployment stuff like vercel). What do you think?

and if I need to fix any bugs or anything, I will need to use vpn and update the files right? (troublesome thing -.-). anyways, thank you for your help. I look forward to hearing your opinion on what I should use

Client use case -

1. purely on mobile, will access throught a domain
2. all users will be located on malaysia. maybe the delivery guy will use it too (in australia)

TL;DR

1. What backend/database should I use for this project?
2. What should I use for deployment?
3. I need to use VPN every time I deal with this project once its online, yes?
